## Anonymous Frear Hall RA
Overall I believe that the DormU system was very easy to understand and navigate and it incorporates a lot of the features that RAs could use to communicate to their RAs. 

### Pros:
* Simple, understandable
* Calendar really helps to promote events

### Cons:
* Not enough feautures
* Laggy/Unresponsive at times

## Danny Y. (Frear Hall RA)
I think that the system is really well put together. It addresses a lot of the things that are missing from the current way that RA's are able to communcicate to residents.

### Pros:
* Easy to connect to residents
* Start of using technology to reach residents

### Cons:
* Bit of a learning curve to use
* A few of the features do not work as intended

## Anonymous Frear Hall Resident
I think that the system is pretty good conceptually. I wish there were more feautures that helped us connect with others, possibly by major or by common classes. 

### Pros:
* Good looking design
* Might use the announcements

### Cons:
* Not enough feautures
* Wish there was a bit more customization
